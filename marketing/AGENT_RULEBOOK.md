# Agent rulebook (Sal / Palm Beach Vitality)

## Spreadsheets
- Do **not** create, rename, overwrite, or modify any spreadsheet unless Sal names it by its **exact name** in that request.
- Reference-only mentions do **not** grant permission.

## CSV updates — always send the file link
**Every time** a `.csv` file is created or updated, the reply **must** include a hard link to that file in the same message.

Use the branch blob URL form:

`https://github.com/PalmBeach-Vitality/pep/blob/<branch>/<path>`

Also include the matching `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL when Sal needs a direct download/import URL.

Do not only say “updated the CSV” — always paste the link(s).

Example (current Pep scenes sheet):

`https://github.com/PalmBeach-Vitality/pep/blob/cursor/palm-beach-pep-scenes-8510/marketing/sheets/150-pb-pep-scenes.csv`

## Always send hard links after file updates
Whenever you update a file Sal needs to download, import, or open, **immediately include the hard link** in the same reply.

Use the same blob URL form as above. Raw GitHub URLs are fine for direct download/import.

## n8n
- New node names: `lower_case_with_underscores`
- One node (or tight group) at a time, with exact node names

- Keep `vid_gen_palm_beach_pep` separate from other video workflows
- Pep weekly plan: `marketing/n8n-vid-gen-palm-beach-pep-weekly-plan.md`

## Social / Imagine
- Aspect ratio for Pep + landscape social workflows: always **9:16**
